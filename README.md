**Problem Statement:** Edit pose of an object in a scene
Recent advancement in generative AI has led to a development of a lot of creative workflows. One
such workflow is to use generative AI techniques for editing product photographs after they have
been shot at a studio, for example to polish the scene for displaying the product on an e-commerce
website. One such post-production editing requirement could be editing the pose of the object by
rotating it within the same scene.
This problem statement involves two tasks - for the eventual goal of developing technology for a
user-friendly pose edit functionality. The first task is to segment an object (defined by a user given
class prompt) in a given scene. This enables the ‘user-friendly’ part of the problem statement. The
second task is to edit the pose of the object by taking user poses (e.g. Azimuth +10 degrees, Polar -5
degrees). The final generated scene should look realistic and composite.

the amazing one you have in your skull) and creatively find solutions to the two tasks
